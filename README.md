# Censys Community-Supported Integrations

Welcome to the Censys Community-Supported Integrations Repository! This repository is a collection of integrations created and maintained by the community, for use with Censys products. Please note that while these integrations are designed to enhance your experience with our products, they are not officially supported by Censys.

## What are Community-Supported Integrations?
Community-Supported Integrations are developed and contributed by enthusiastic individuals and developers within the Censys user community. These integrations extend the functionality of our products and provide innovative solutions to specific use cases. They can cover a wide range of features, from data visualization tools to automation scripts, and more.

## Important Considerations
Before you start using any of the integrations from this repository, here are some important things to keep in mind:

- **No Official Support**: These integrations are not officially supported by Censys. They are created and maintained by community members on a voluntary basis. As a result, you may encounter issues, bugs, or lack of updates that are not addressed by our official support channels.

- **Varied Quality**: The quality, stability, and security of these integrations can vary. While some integrations might be polished and well-documented, others could be experimental or under ongoing development. Make sure to review the documentation and code carefully before using an integration in a production environment.

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: By using any integration from this repository, you are acknowledging that you are doing so at your own risk. Censys is not responsible for any potential data loss, security breaches, or other negative consequences that may arise from the use of community-supported integrations.

## Getting Started
To use an integration from this repository, follow these general steps:

1. Browse the Repository: Explore the repository's contents to find the integration that meets your needs. Each integration typically has its own dedicated directory containing the necessary code and documentation.

2. Review Documentation: Open the integration's directory and review any available documentation. Pay attention to installation instructions, configuration options, usage examples, and any known issues.

3. Installation: Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation. Integrations might require different setup processes, such as installing dependencies, configuring API tokens, or modifying configuration files.

4. Testing: Before using the integration in a production environment, it's recommended to thoroughly test it in a controlled and non-critical environment. This will help you identify any potential issues or conflicts.

5. Contributions: If you're a developer and would like to contribute to an existing integration or add a new one, please refer to the contribution guidelines in the repository. We encourage collaboration within the community to improve and maintain these integrations.
